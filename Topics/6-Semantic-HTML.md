## What is Semantic HTML?

Simply put, Semantic HTML is using Semantic elements which are HTML elements with meaning.

The HTML element being used clearly indicates to the browser and anyone reading the code what the HTML element is doing.

For example

```
<nav> 
  <!-- code for nav bar -->
</nav>
```

This `nav` tag is used as the container for the code for a navigation bar. This lets the browser or anyone viewing the code know what to expect.

Non-semantic elements are ones like `div` and `span` as they do not give any indication as to what the content of the element contains.

## Why is it useful?

<br>
<p align="center" >
  <img src="./assets/page-layout.png" width="40%" />
</p>
<br>

Semantic HTML makes the code easier to understand for any viewer and for the browser.

It also makes a web page easier to layout when coding - Imagine a large web page with 100's of `div` elements!

Using Semantic HTML is good practice for breaking down web pages and thinking like a web developer.

## Examples

Here are some common examples:

- `<nav>`: Defines a navigation section for the web page
- `<main>`: Specifies area for the main content of the web page
- `<header>`: Defines the header section of a document
- `<section>`: For a section in a document
- `<figure>`: Defines self-contained content, such as an image, diagram, ect...
- `<article>`: Defines independent, self-contained content
- `<aside>`: For content aside of the main content
- `<footer>`: For a footer section in a web page
